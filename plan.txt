TODO by the end of the month:
- Make the code run
- Train the agents myself (dont consider overfitting right now)
- Do a basic hyperparameter optimization
- Add more possible actions (short and long continuous amount)
- Add more features (order book data)
- Incorporate feature importance
- See if it can train better
- Address the problem of overfitting as in the paper.
